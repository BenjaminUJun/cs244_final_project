First, request access to the CAIDA dataset. We cannot share these files 
without permission, but you should be able to get access in a few days. 
    https://www.caida.org/data/passive/ddos-20070804_dataset.xml

Next, in order to use dpkt, I recommend spinning up a standard Ubuntu 
instance on AWS with at least 50GB of disk space and 32 GB of memory 
(This may be overkill, but it will definitely work). 

SSH into the machine using the -X flag.

When you have the machine set up, download the attack files with the 
following command:

    wget --user=<username> --password=<pass> -r -nH -nd -np -R index.html* https://data.caida.org/datasets/security/ddos-20070804/to-victim/

Then, clone our github repo. 

    git clone https://github.com/felipems/cs244_final_project

Run our setup script to install any dependencies that might be needed.

    ./installer.sh

In order to reproduce the results, run:

    python detector.py <pcap_file>

The graph will pop up once the pcap file is fully processed and we 
have done all the sampling methods. 

If you find that youâ€™re hitting a segmentation fault after processing m packets, 
pass in the flag -m to cap the maximum number of packets read (in millions) 
from a file.

    python detector.py -m 10 <pcap_file>

So this will stop once you read 10 million packets.  The AWS instance with 32GB 
of RAM should allow you to read ~27million packets, though.

We ran the CAIDA graphs with the pcap file ddostrace.to-victim.20070804_141436.pcap, 
and the original dataset with exp31.pcap. Feel free to run on the other CAIDA pcap files
if you so desire, but some of them are too large/too small.
